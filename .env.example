# Firestore Configuration
# GCP project ID for Firestore operations
# REQUIRED: Set this to your Google Cloud Platform project ID
# Example: FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID=my-gcp-project-123
FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id

# Path to GCP service account credentials JSON file
# REQUIRED for local development: Download your service account key from GCP Console
# For Cloud Run deployment: This can be omitted as Cloud Run uses workload identity
# Example: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account-key.json
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account-key.json

# Service Configuration
# Port for the service (default: 8080, valid range: 1-65535)
# Cloud Run automatically sets this to 8080, no need to override in Cloud Run
PORT=8080

# Service name for logging and identification
# Used in structured logs for service identification
SERVICE_NAME=plan-scheduler

# Pub/Sub Configuration
# Verification token for authenticating Pub/Sub requests
# REQUIRED for production: Generate a secure random token
# For Cloud Run: This should be stored in Secret Manager and injected as an env var
# When using Cloud Run with IAM authentication, you can also rely on Cloud Run's
# built-in authentication instead of this token
# Generate a secure token: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
# Example of a strong random token (DO NOT use this exact value in production):
# PUBSUB_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=J7ZigtqyXkbATeElXULwz-3Lu1F3q6yJ-8dpBkwBMLU
PUBSUB_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=your-verification-token
